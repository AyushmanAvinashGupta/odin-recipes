# Odin Recipes

This is my first Project from the "The Odin Project" curriculum. It is a simple website that contains recipes on webpages built using HTML.

This project showcases my skills in HTML such as - basic HTML document structure, semantic elements, how to handle text in HTML, and how to create lists, links, and images.

It also showcases my skills in git in the form of my commit messages.
