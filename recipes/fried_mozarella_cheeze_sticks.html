        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Did you know you don't have to go out to enjoy restaurant-worthy mozzarella sticks? Well, you don't! With this top-rated recipe, you can make irresistible fried mozzarella cheese sticks in the comfort of your own home.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>¼ cup water</li>
            <li>2 cups italian style seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl. Heat oil in a deep fryer or large, heavy saucepan to 365°F (185°C).</li>
            <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in the flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into the egg mixture, allowing excess to drip off. Press into the bread crumbs to coat. Repeat dipping in the egg and bread crumbs to create a double coating. Place breaded mozzarella sticks on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Freeze until firm, about 45 minutes, to help the coating set and prevent cheese from oozing during frying.</li>
            <li>Working in batches, carefully lower 3 to 4 frozen mozzarella sticks into the hot oil using a spider spoon or tongs. Fry until golden brown, about 1 to 2 minutes, turning occasionally for even color. Avoid overcrowding the pan to maintain oil temperature. Remove fried sticks with tongs and drain on paper towels. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
